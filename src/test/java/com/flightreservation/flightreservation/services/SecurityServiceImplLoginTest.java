================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Plain Text Authentication (CWE-256)
Issue: The provided password is not encrypted before it is used to create a UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken. If an attacker intercepts the password at this point, they will get it in plain text and potentially gain unauthorized access.
Solution: Secure the password by hashing it before creating the UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken. Consider using bcrypt hashing function for example.

Vulnerability: Bad Authentication Method (CWE-308)
Issue: The authentication relies heavily on the 'authenticate()' method, which could throw exceptions that may lead to denial of service or provide attackers with sensitive information. Moreover, there isn't any restriction on the number of attempts, which opens the door for brute force attacks.
Solution: Handle all exceptions carefully, don't expose sensitive error messages to the client and consider implementing account lockout or delay features after a certain number of failed login attempts to prevent brute force attacks.

Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
Issue: The 'loadUserByUsername' function might expose controllers to an Insecure Direct Object References vulnerability if it is used inappropriately elsewhere. If the function doesn't properly authenticate and authorize an object request, an attacker can manipulate references to gain unauthorized access.
Solution: Ensure that the function always checks an authenticated user’s authorization to the requested object. Use approaches like user session verification to mitigate the risk.

Vulnerability: Weak Cryptography (CWE-327)
Issue: If user details or authentication tokens are stored without proper encryption, an attacker might be able to exploit these weak points to breach the system.
Solution: Always store sensitive data like user details and authentication tokens in encrypted form. Java provides numerous libraries which can be used for this task.

"""
Scenario 1: Successful Login

Details:
  TestName: testSuccessfulLogin
  Description: This test is meant to check if the login method is working correctly for valid username and password.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up the username and password with valid strings. Mock UserDetailsService and AuthenticationManager.
    Act: Invoke the login method with the username and password.
    Assert: Verify that the method returns true.
  Validation:
    This assertion verifies that when a user tries to login with valid credentials, the method should authenticate successfully and return true. This implicates that the authentication process is functional as expected.

Scenario 2: Unsuccessful Login - Wrong Password

Details:
  TestName: testLoginWithWrongPassword
  Description: This test is meant to check how the login method behaves when an invalid password is given.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up the username with a valid string and password with an invalid string. Mock UserDetailsService and AuthenticationManager.
    Act: Invoke the login method with the username an invalid password.
    Assert: Verify that the method returns false.
  Validation:
    This assertion verifies that an invalid password prevents a user from logging in successfully. This is important to ensure the security and privacy of user accounts.

Scenario 3: Login for Non-Existing User

Details:
  TestName: testLoginForNonExistingUser
  Description: This test is meant to check how the login method handles a scenario where a username doesn't exist.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a username that doesn't exist in the system and any password. Mock UserDetailsService so that it returns null user details for this username.
    Act: Invoke the login method with the non-existing username and password.
    Assert: Verify that an exception is thrown.
  Validation:
    The test checks whether the system identifies that the username does not exist. This validation ensures that the system can prevent fraudulent login attempts and manages non-existent user cases appropriately.

Scenario 4: Null Username

Details:
  TestName: testLoginWithNullUsername
  Description: This test is meant to check how the system handles a null value for a username.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a null username value and a password.
    Act: Invoke the login method with null as username and password.
    Assert: Verify that an exception is thrown.
  Validation:
    The validation here checks whether the system is able to handle null inputs which helps in maintaining the system robustness.

Scenario 5: Null Password

Details:
  TestName: testLoginWithNullPassword
  Description: This test is meant to check how the system handles a null value for a password.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a username value and a null password.
    Act: Invoke the login method with username and null as password.
    Assert: Verify that an exception is thrown.
  Validation:
    The test checks whether the system handles null password inputs, ensuring the system’s error management capabilities are resilient.
