================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials
Issue: The method receives password as a method argument. This may lead to exposure of sensitive data, as it could be logged or monitored, and becomes susceptible to issues such as leakage of logs.
Solution: Never log sensitive information. Make sure that the application does not log sensitive data, and API provided by third-party libraries do not inadvertently do this.

Vulnerability: CWE-309: Use of Password System for Primary Authentication
Issue: The password-based authentication may have several potential issues like replay attacks, weak passwords, password recovery, etc.
Solution: Enforce strong password rules. Enable a second-factor authentication method. Hash passwords when at rest and protect them in transit with effective encryption. Use multiple layers of validation and checks.

Vulnerability: CWE-601: URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')
Issue: If the userDetailsService is not implemented correctly or if it doesn't properly handle request, it might leave the door open for URL redirection attacks.
Solution: Validate and sanitize inputs. Whitelist trusted URLs that the application can redirect to rather than relying on user input. Implement userDetailsService correctly.

Vulnerability: CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials
Issue: If the userDetailsService or authenticationManager contains hardcoded credentials, then it's a serious security vulnerability. The credentials could be exposed to an attacker in case of any application misconfiguration or vulnerability.
Solution: Never hard-code credentials. They should be securely managed, for example, utilizing secure environment variables or secret management solutions.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Valid User Login

Details:
  TestName: testValidUserLogin
  Description: This test is meant to check if a user can perform a successful login with valid username and password.
  Execution:
    Arrange: The mock objects for the UserDetails, UserDetailsService, and AuthenticationManager are set. Correct username and password, matching with the mock user details, are also specified.
    Act: The login method is invoked using the correct username and password.
    Assert: Assert that the response from the login method is true.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that a user with valid credentials is successfully authenticated. This is crucial to ensure that only authorised users can access the system.

Scenario 2: Invalid User Login

Details:
  TestName: testInvalidUserLogin
  Description: This test is meant to check if the system correctly refuses login when invalid credentials are provided.
  Execution:
    Arrange: The mock objects for the UserDetails, UserDetailsService, and AuthenticationManager are set. Incorrect username and password are inputted.
    Act: The login method is invoked using the incorrect username and password.
    Assert: Assert that the response from the login method is false.
  Validation:
    The assertion checks whether invalid login attempts are accurately rejected. This is essential for security reasons, deterring unwanted access to the system.

Scenario 3: Null User Login

Details:
  TestName: testNullUserLogin
  Description: This test is meant to check what happens when null values are passed for username and password.
  Execution:
    Arrange: The mock objects for the UserDetails, UserDetailsService, and AuthenticationManager are set. Null values for username and password are inputted.
    Act: The login method is invoked using the null values.
    Assert: Assert that an exception is thrown.
  Validation:
    This check is significant as it asserts the method's ability to handle null values, which is considered an edge-case scenario.

Scenario 4: User Login with Empty Strings

Details:
  TestName: testUserLoginWithEmptyStrings
  Description: This test is meant to verify that the user cannot log in with empty username and password.
  Execution:
    Arrange: The mock objects for the UserDetails, UserDetailsService, and AuthenticationManager are set. Empty strings for username and password are inputted.
    Act: The login method is invoked as per the conditions.
    Assert: Assert  that the response from the login method is false.
  Validation:
    This assertion examines the robustness of the login method against trivial or faulty inputs, which is essential for maintaining the systemâ€™s integrity and security.
