ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=bookFlight_b65373531f

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) or CWE-639
Issue: The function `bookFlight` takes a `ReservationRequest` as an argument. If the request object became manipulatable by a malicious user, it's possible the user could modify data they shouldn't have access to.
Solution: It is recommended to verify the requester has the correct permissions to modify the data they are sending.

Vulnerability: Possible SQL Injection or CWE-89
Issue: If the `ReservationRequest`, `bookFlight` isn't properly sanitized, it may be vulnerable to an SQL Injection attack, which can allow a malicious actor to manipulate SQL queries, access sensitive data, or perform other unintended operations.
Solution: Make sure to always use prepared statements, parameterized queries, or ORM libraries to ensure all data sent to the database is properly treated as input data.

Vulnerability: Insecure Dependency or CWE-829
Issue: There are a number of import statements regarding various libraries. If these libraries have not been reviewed or are out of date, they could contain known vulnerabilities.
Solution: Insure you're using the most up to date version of the library and the library has been reviewed and deemed safe.

================================================================================
"""
Scenario 1: Test with Valid Reservation Request

Details:
  TestName: testWithValidReservationRequest
  Description: This test ensures that the method bookFlight functions as expected when provided with a valid ReservationRequest object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a valid mock ReservationRequest object.
  Act: Call the bookFlight method with the mock ReservationRequest as the parameter.
  Assert: Check if the returned Reservation object is not null and has the expected flight details.
Validation:
  This asserts the proper functioning of the bookFlight method when handling a valid ReservationRequest object. This is crucial as it's the basic functionality of flight booking.

Scenario 2: Test with Invalid/null Reservation Request

Details:
  TestName: testWithInvalidReservationRequest
  Description: This scenario is intended to test how the bookFlight method handles an invalid or null ReservationRequest object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Pass a null or invalid ReservationRequest object.
  Act: Call the bookFlight method with the invalid/null ReservationRequest object as the parameter.
  Assert: Throw an IllegalArgumentException or a NullPointerException (depending upon the handling in your code) since the input is invalid.
Validation:
  The test aims to ensure that the bookFlight method is capable of handling error scenarios and effectively preventing system crashes due to null/invalid inputs.

Scenario 3: Test with Reservation Request having non-existing/invalid flightId

Details:
  TestName: testWithNonExistingFlightId
  Description: This test is designed to check the behavior of the bookFlight method when the ReservationRequest object refers to a non-existing or invalid flightId.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a ReservationRequest object where flightId does not exist or is invalid.
  Act: Call the bookFlight method with the ReservationRequest as a parameter.
  Assert: Assert if the method throws an Exception denoting an invalid or non-existing flightId.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies the ability of the bookFlight method to handle scenarios where non-existing or invalid flightId is supplied.

Scenario 4: Test when flight is fully booked

Details:
  TestName: testWhenFlightIsFullyBooked
  Description: This test ensures the bookFlight method handles scenarios when the specified flight is fully booked.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a ReservationRequest for a flight that is already fully booked.
  Act: Call the bookFlight method with the ReservationRequest as a parameter.
  Assert: Expect the method to throw an Exception indicating that the requested flight is fully booked.
Validation:
  The test verifies the system's capacity to handle situations when a flight has reached its maximum reservation limit.
