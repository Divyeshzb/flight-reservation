"""
Scenario 1: Test When Reservation Request Is Valid
Details:
    TestName: testValidReservationRequest
    Description: This test will validate a successful scenario where a valid ReservationRequest is provided.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a valid ReservationRequest with all the necessary details.
    Act: Call bookFlight method using the valid ReservationRequest.
    Assert: Assert if the returned Reservation is not null/assert if return type matches Reservation class.
Validation:
    The assertion verifies whether a valid ReservationRequest returns a valid Reservation or not, expected result is not null or matching return type. This test ensures the correctness of the method when provided with valid data.

Scenario 2: Test When ReservationRequest Is Null
Details:
    TestName: testNullReservationRequest
    Description: This test will validate the bookFlight processing when a null ReservationRequest is provided.
Execution:
    Arrange: Set ReservationRequest to null.
    Act: Call bookFlight method with null ReservationRequest.
    Assert: Assert if the returned Reservation is null/assert if an exception is thrown.
Validation:
    The assertion verifies that null ReservationRequest will not create a Reservation. It checks the method's ability to handle null inputs.

Scenario 3: Test When Reservation Request Contains Invalid Data
Details:
    TestName: testInvalidReservationRequestData
    Description: This test scenario checks whether the method can handle reservation requests with invalid data.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a ReservationRequest with invalid data.
    Act: Invoke the bookFlight method using the invalid ReservationRequest.
    Assert: Assert if the returned Reservation null/assert if an exception is thrown.
Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that invalid ReservationRequest data are managed correctly. It tests the method's robustness against data inconsistency.

Scenario 4: Test When ReservationRequest Does Not Contain Required Fields
Details:
    TestName: testMissingRequiredFieldsInReservationRequest
    Description: This scene assesses the impact of an incomplete ReservationRequest on the method.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a ReservationRequest missing required fields.
    Act: Call bookFlight using the incomplete ReservationRequest.
    Assert: Assert if the returned Reservation is null/assert if an exception is thrown.
Validation:
    The assertion checks if missing required fields in ReservationRequest are correctly unidentified. It ensures the method's correctness in handling missing data scenario.

Scenario 5: Test When Database Connection Fails During Reservation
Details:
    TestName: testDatabaseConnectionFailureDuringReservation
    Description: This test scenario analyses the procedure when a database connection problem occurs during the reservation process.
Execution:
    Arrange: Simulate a database connection failure.
    Act: Invoke the bookFlight method.
    Assert: Assert if an exception is thrown.
Validation:
    The assertion verifies that a database connection failure is appropriately managed. It tests the system's robustness against external factors like database availability.
