================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-259: Hard-Coded Password
Issue: This vulnerability issue arises when passwords or secrets are hard-coded in the program, which can potentially be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access by reverse engineering the application.
Solution: Avoid hard-coding passwords. Use a proper security mechanism, such as Java's KeyStore or java.security.SecureRandom for generating random passwords, or environment variables for storing sensitive information.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The code snippet does not demonstrate robust input validation from the ReservationRequest object, which can open up serious security vulnerabilities like SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or Remote Code Execution (RCE).
Solution: Ensure that all inputs are properly validated and sanitized before processing. Use Java's features like the java.util.regex package for input validation or third-party libraries or frameworks like Hibernate Validator or Spring's @Valid annotation.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: While logging, sensitive information like a passenger's personal data, flight details, and reservation details are being exposed. This can breach user privacy and aid attackers in phishing attempts.
Solution: Implement a proper logging policy. Sensitive data should never be logged. Use a logging framework that supports masking or redacting sensitive data.

Vulnerability: CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource
Issue: The method generateItenary is likely creating a PDF that could contain sensitive information. If the improperly permissioned PDF file gets written to a shared directory, this could allow an attacker to access the contents.
Solution: Ensure that the file permissions are set correctly. Use the java.nio.file.attribute package's PosixFilePermission to set the appropriate permissions.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test to ensure a Reservation is created successfully when valid ReservationRequest is provided
Details:
    TestName: testSuccessfullyBookingOfFlight.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the 'bookFlight' method successfully creates a Flight reservation when a valid 'ReservationRequest' is provided.
    Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the 'ReservationRequest','Flight', 'Passenger', 'PassengerRepository', 'ReservationRepository', 'FlightRepository' and 'PdfGenerator'.
    Act: Invoke 'bookFlight()' with the mock 'ReservationRequest'.
    Assert: Verify that 'ReservationRepository.save()' is called and receives a 'Reservation' object.
    Validation:
    Verifies that the system can successfully save an instance of 'Reservation'. It's important for the system to persist a booking after it's created in order to retrieve and manipulate later.

Scenario 2: Test to check if FlightNotFound Exception is Thrown when ReservationRequest with non-existing flightId is provided
Details:
    TestName: testForNonExistingFlightId.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the 'bookFlight()' method throws 'FlightNotFound' exception when given a 'ReservationRequest' with a non-existing flightId.
    Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the 'ReservationRequest','FlightRepository', provide non-existent flightId in 'ReservationRequest'.
    Act: Invoke 'bookFlight()' with the mock 'ReservationRequest'.
    Assert: Expect 'FlightNotFound' exception.
    Validation:
    Verifies that the system correctly handles the case when a flight not present in the database is queried. This is crucial for data integrity and error handling.

Scenario 3: Test to verify that an Itinerary PDF is created and sent via email after successful booking
Details:
    TestName: testItenaryPdfGenerationAndSendingEmail.
    Description: This test is meant to check if after the successful creation of a reservation the system generates a Itinerary PDF and sends it via email.
    Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the 'ReservationRequest', 'Flight', 'Passenger', 'PassengerRepository', 'ReservationRepository', 'FlightRepository', 'PdfGenerator' and 'EmailUtil'.
    Act: Invoke 'bookFlight()' with the mock 'ReservationRequest'.
    Assert: Verify that 'PdfGenerator.generateItenary()' is called and it receives the correct parameters. Also, verify that 'EmailUtil.sendItenary()' is invoked with proper parameters.
    Validation:
    Verifies that an itinerary PDF is created and an e-mail containing it is sent successfully after a booking. This ensures that confirmation and booking details are delivered to the user.

Scenario 4: Test to verify Passenger details are stored correctly in the database
Details:
    TestName: testCorrectStoringOfPassengerDetails.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the 'bookFlight()' method correctly stores the passenger details provided in the 'ReservationRequest' in the database.
    Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the 'ReservationRequest', 'PassengerRepository', and provide correct passenger details in 'ReservationRequest'.
    Act: Invoke 'bookFlight()' with the mock 'ReservationRequest'.
    Assert: Verify that 'PassengerRepository.save()' is called and it receives a 'Passenger' object with correct details.
    Validation:
    Verifies that the system correctly stores passenger details into the database. This is essential as passenger details are crucial in a flight reservation.

 Scenario 5: Test to check if ReservationisCheckedin defaults to false when booking is made
Details:
    TestName: testDefaultCheckInStatus.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the 'bookFlight' method sets the 'Reservation.isCheckedIn' status to false by default when a new booking is made.
    Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the 'ReservationRequest', 'Flight', 'Passenger', 'PassengerRepository', 'ReservationRepository' and 'FlightRepository'.
    Act: Invoke 'bookFlight()' with the mock 'ReservationRequest'.
    Assert: Verify that 'Reservation.isCheckedin()' is false.
    Validation:
    Verifies that the system correctly sets the check-in status to false by default when a new reservation is made, which reflects the real-world scenario of booking a flight.
