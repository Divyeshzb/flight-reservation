 *
 * ================================VULNERABILITIES================================
 * Vulnerability: CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions Issue: The code generates a PDF
 * itinerary and saves it in a directory defined by constant ITINERARY_DIR. If this
 * directory has incorrect default permissions, it could lead to unauthorized access to
 * the generated itineraries. Solution: Ensure that the ITINERARY_DIR directory has strict
 * file permissions set. Only authorized users and services should have read, write, or
 * execute permissions.
 *
 * Vulnerability: CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message Issue: In the
 * case when a flight is not found, the code throws a FlightNotFound exception with
 * detailed information about the absent flight. This can inadvertently expose internal
 * details to an end user. Solution: Avoid exposing detailed exception information to the
 * user. Log the detailed error for debugging purposes and show a generic error message to
 * the user.
 *
 * Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation') Issue:
 * Personal data of passengers such as first, middle, last names, email, and phone number
 * are logged in plaintext. This could lead to violation of privacy and data protection
 * laws if logs are not properly secured. Solution: Avoid logging sensitive information in
 * plaintext. Use anonymization or pseudonymization for personal information if logging is
 * needed.
 *
 * Vulnerability: CWE-610: Externally Controlled Reference to a Resource in Another Sphere
 * Issue: The email used to send the itinerary appears to be hardcoded
 * ('dlulla@akamai.com'). Besides being a potential privacy concern, this could lead to
 * emails being sent to an unintended recipient if not implemented correctly. Solution:
 * The email should be retrieved from a secure source at runtime, such as from secure user
 * input, rather than being hardcoded into the application.
 *
 * Vulnerability: CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information Issue: The
 * email with attachment containing potentially sensitive passenger information might not
 * be sent over a secure protocol, leading to possible eavesdropping or Man-in-the-Middle
 * (MITM) attacks. Solution: Ensure that emails are sent over a secure channel using
 * protocols like SSL/TLS.

 * ================================================================================ """
 * Scenario 1: Test Flight Reservation Process with Valid Data
 *
 * Details: TestName: testSuccessfulFlightReservation. Description: This test validates if
 * the flight reservation process is successful when valid data is provided. Execution:
 * Arrange: Mock ReservationRequest with valid data and all Repositories. Prepare a valid
 * flightId and corresponding Flight object. Run the process to save passenger and
 * reservation details. Act: Call bookFlight method with valid ReservationRequest. Assert:
 * Compare the returned Reservation object with expected Reservation. Validation: This
 * test verifies that the flight booking goes through successfully given valid data. It
 * confirms the correct function of our business logic when it encounters normal,
 * expected, and valid input.
 *
 * Scenario 2: Test Flight Reservation Process with Invalid Flight ID
 *
 * Details: TestName: testFlightReservationWithInvalidFlightId. Description: This test
 * verifies if the flight reservation process fails when an invalid or non-existent flight
 * id is provided. Execution: Arrange: Mock ReservationRequest with valid data except for
 * a non-existing flight ID. Prepare Mock Repositories. Act: Call bookFlight method with
 * ReservationRequest containing invalid flight ID. Assert: Assert if FlightNotFound
 * exception is thrown. Validation: The test validates if the code correctly throws an
 * exception when a non-existent or invalid flight id is provided. It adds necessary
 * validation to prevent incorrect data from entering our system.
 *
 * Scenario 3: Test for PDF Generation and Email Delivery during Reservation
 *
 * Details: TestName: testPdfGenerationAndEmailDelivery. Description: This test confirms
 * whether a PDF itinerary is generated and an email notification sent when a reservation
 * is made successfully. Execution: Arrange: Mock ReservationRequest with valid data and
 * all Repositories. Prepare a valid flightId and corresponding Flight object. Run the
 * process to save passenger and reservation details. Mock PdfGenerator and EmailUtil.
 * Act: Call bookFlight method with valid ReservationRequest. Assert: Assert if
 * PdfGenerator.generateItenary was called with the correct parameters. Assert if
 * EmailUtil.sendItenary was called with the correct parameters. Validation: This test
 * aims to verify if a pdf itinerary is correctly generated and an email is sent on
 * successfully booking a flight, checking the intertwined systems' functionality.
