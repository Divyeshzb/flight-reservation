Here are some JUnit test scenarios for the provided toString() method:
Scenario 1: Test toString() with checkedIn set to true
Details:
  TestName: toStringWithCheckedInTrue()
  Description: This test verifies that the toString() method correctly includes the checkedIn field when it is set to true.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Reservation object with checkedIn set to true, numberOfBags set to a valid value, and valid Passenger and Flight objects.
  Act: Call the toString() method on the Reservation object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned string contains "checkedin=true".
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the toString() method properly includes the checkedIn field and its value in the output string.
  This test is important to validate that the toString() method accurately represents the state of the Reservation object.
Scenario 2: Test toString() with checkedIn set to false
Details:
  TestName: toStringWithCheckedInFalse()
  Description: This test verifies that the toString() method correctly includes the checkedIn field when it is set to false.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Reservation object with checkedIn set to false, numberOfBags set to a valid value, and valid Passenger and Flight objects.
  Act: Call the toString() method on the Reservation object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned string contains "checkedin=false".
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the toString() method properly includes the checkedIn field and its value in the output string.
  This test is important to validate that the toString() method accurately represents the state of the Reservation object.
Scenario 3: Test toString() with numberOfBags set to zero
Details:
  TestName: toStringWithZeroBags()
  Description: This test verifies that the toString() method correctly includes the numberOfBags field when it is set to zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Reservation object with numberOfBags set to zero, checkedIn set to a valid value, and valid Passenger and Flight objects.
  Act: Call the toString() method on the Reservation object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned string contains "numberOfBags=0".
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the toString() method properly includes the numberOfBags field and its value in the output string.
  This test is important to validate that the toString() method accurately represents the state of the Reservation object, even when numberOfBags is zero.
Scenario 4: Test toString() with numberOfBags set to a positive value
Details:
  TestName: toStringWithPositiveBags()
  Description: This test verifies that the toString() method correctly includes the numberOfBags field when it is set to a positive value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Reservation object with numberOfBags set to a positive value, checkedIn set to a valid value, and valid Passenger and Flight objects.
  Act: Call the toString() method on the Reservation object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned string contains "numberOfBags=" followed by the expected positive value.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the toString() method properly includes the numberOfBags field and its value in the output string.
  This test is important to validate that the toString() method accurately represents the state of the Reservation object when numberOfBags is a positive value.
Scenario 5: Test toString() with a valid Passenger object
Details:
  TestName: toStringWithValidPassenger()
  Description: This test verifies that the toString() method correctly includes the passenger field when it is set to a valid Passenger object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Reservation object with a valid Passenger object, checkedIn and numberOfBags set to valid values, and a valid Flight object.
  Act: Call the toString() method on the Reservation object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned string contains the expected string representation of the Passenger object.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the toString() method properly includes the passenger field and its string representation in the output string.
  This test is important to validate that the toString() method accurately represents the associated Passenger object in the Reservation.
Scenario 6: Test toString() with a valid Flight object
Details:
  TestName: toStringWithValidFlight()
  Description: This test verifies that the toString() method correctly includes the flight field when it is set to a valid Flight object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Reservation object with a valid Flight object, checkedIn and numberOfBags set to valid values, and a valid Passenger object.
  Act: Call the toString() method on the Reservation object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned string contains the expected string representation of the Flight object.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the toString() method properly includes the flight field and its string representation in the output string.
  This test is important to validate that the toString() method accurately represents the associated Flight object in the Reservation.
Scenario 7: Test toString() with null Passenger and Flight objects
Details:
  TestName: toStringWithNullPassengerAndFlight()
  Description: This test verifies that the toString() method handles null Passenger and Flight objects gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Reservation object with passenger and flight fields set to null, and checkedIn and numberOfBags set to valid values.
  Act: Call the toString() method on the Reservation object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned string contains "passenger=null" and "flight=null".
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the toString() method properly handles null Passenger and Flight objects and includes appropriate null indicators in the output string.
  This test is important to validate that the toString() method does not throw exceptions and provides meaningful output even when associated objects are null.
These test scenarios cover various aspects of the toString() method, including different values for checkedIn and numberOfBags, as well as handling valid and null Passenger and Flight objects. They ensure that the toString() method accurately represents the state of the Reservation object in the output string.
