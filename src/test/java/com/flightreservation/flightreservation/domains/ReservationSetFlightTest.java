Here are the JUnit test scenarios for the setFlight method:
Scenario 1: Setting a valid Flight object
Details:
  TestName: setFlightWithValidFlight
  Description: This test checks if the setFlight method correctly sets a valid Flight object to the flight field of the class.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a valid Flight object.
  Act: Invoke the setFlight method with the created Flight object.
  Assert: Use assertions to verify that the flight field of the class is set to the provided Flight object.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the setFlight method properly assigns the provided Flight object to the flight field.
  This test ensures that the setFlight method functions as expected when given a valid Flight object.
Scenario 2: Setting a null Flight object
Details:
  TestName: setFlightWithNullFlight
  Description: This test checks if the setFlight method handles setting a null Flight object correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a null Flight object.
  Act: Invoke the setFlight method with the null Flight object.
  Assert: Use assertions to verify that the flight field of the class is set to null.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the setFlight method allows setting the flight field to null.
  This test ensures that the setFlight method does not throw any exceptions or have unexpected behavior when given a null Flight object.
Scenario 3: Setting a Flight object when the flight field is already set
Details:
  TestName: setFlightWhenFlightIsAlreadySet
  Description: This test checks if the setFlight method correctly updates the flight field when it is already set to a different Flight object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two different valid Flight objects. Set the flight field of the class to the first Flight object.
  Act: Invoke the setFlight method with the second Flight object.
  Assert: Use assertions to verify that the flight field of the class is updated to the second Flight object.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the setFlight method properly updates the flight field when it is already set to a different Flight object.
  This test ensures that the setFlight method allows updating the flight field and does not have any unintended side effects.
Scenario 4: Setting a Flight object and checking the impact on other fields
Details:
  TestName: setFlightAndCheckOtherFields
  Description: This test checks if setting a Flight object using the setFlight method has any impact on other fields of the class.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a valid Flight object. Set the values of other fields (checkedIn, numberOfBags, passenger) of the class.
  Act: Invoke the setFlight method with the created Flight object.
  Assert: Use assertions to verify that the values of other fields remain unchanged after setting the flight field.
Validation:
  The assertions verify that the setFlight method does not modify or have any side effects on other fields of the class.
  This test ensures that the setFlight method only sets the flight field and does not unintentionally alter other fields.
Note: The test scenarios assume the existence of a Flight class and the necessary constructors or methods to create Flight objects. The assertions in the test scenarios would need to be adjusted based on the specific implementation and requirements of the application.
