Here are the JUnit test scenarios for the provided getFlight() method:
Scenario 1: Get Flight When Flight is Set
Details:
  TestName: getFlightWhenFlightIsSet()
  Description: This test checks if the getFlight() method returns the correct Flight object when the flight field is set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of the class containing the getFlight() method and set the flight field to a valid Flight object.
  Act: Invoke the getFlight() method.
  Assert: Use assertEquals to verify that the returned Flight object matches the one set in the Arrange step.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the getFlight() method correctly returns the Flight object stored in the flight field.
  This test ensures that the method behaves as expected when the flight field is properly initialized.
Scenario 2: Get Flight When Flight is Null
Details:
  TestName: getFlightWhenFlightIsNull()
  Description: This test checks if the getFlight() method returns null when the flight field is not set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of the class containing the getFlight() method and ensure that the flight field is null.
  Act: Invoke the getFlight() method.
  Assert: Use assertNull to verify that the returned value is null.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the getFlight() method returns null when the flight field is not initialized.
  This test ensures that the method handles the case when the flight field is null and doesn't throw any exceptions.
Scenario 3: Get Flight After Setting Flight
Details:
  TestName: getFlightAfterSettingFlight()
  Description: This test checks if the getFlight() method returns the updated Flight object after the flight field is modified.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of the class containing the getFlight() method and set the flight field to a valid Flight object.
  Act: Modify the flight field by assigning a new Flight object, then invoke the getFlight() method.
  Assert: Use assertEquals to verify that the returned Flight object matches the newly assigned Flight object.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the getFlight() method returns the most recently assigned Flight object.
  This test ensures that the method reflects any changes made to the flight field and returns the updated value.
Scenario 4: Get Flight When Passenger is Set
Details:
  TestName: getFlightWhenPassengerIsSet()
  Description: This test checks if the getFlight() method returns the correct Flight object when the passenger field is set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of the class containing the getFlight() method, set the passenger field to a valid Passenger object, and set the flight field to a valid Flight object.
  Act: Invoke the getFlight() method.
  Assert: Use assertEquals to verify that the returned Flight object matches the one set in the Arrange step.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the getFlight() method correctly returns the Flight object even when the passenger field is set.
  This test ensures that the presence of a Passenger object does not affect the behavior of the getFlight() method.
Note: The test scenarios assume the existence of Flight and Passenger classes based on the provided field information and imports.
