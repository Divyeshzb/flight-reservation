Here are the JUnit test scenarios for the getArrivalCity() method of the Flight entity:

Scenario 1: Test getArrivalCity returns the correct arrival city

Details:
  TestName: getArrivalCityReturnsCorrectCity
  Description: This test verifies that the getArrivalCity method returns the correct arrival city stored in the Flight entity.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Flight instance and set the arrival city using the setArrivalCity method.
  Act: Call the getArrivalCity method on the Flight instance.
  Assert: Use assertEquals to compare the returned arrival city with the expected value.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the getArrivalCity method retrieves the correct arrival city that was set using setArrivalCity.
  This test ensures that the getter method functions as expected and maintains data integrity.

Scenario 2: Test getArrivalCity returns null when arrival city is not set

Details:
  TestName: getArrivalCityReturnsNullWhenNotSet
  Description: This test verifies that the getArrivalCity method returns null when the arrival city has not been set in the Flight entity.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Flight instance without setting the arrival city.
  Act: Call the getArrivalCity method on the Flight instance.
  Assert: Use assertNull to check if the returned arrival city is null.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the getArrivalCity method returns null when the arrival city has not been explicitly set.
  This test validates that the method handles the case when the arrival city is not available and prevents any unexpected behavior or null pointer exceptions.

Scenario 3: Test getArrivalCity returns the updated arrival city after modification

Details:
  TestName: getArrivalCityReturnsUpdatedCity
  Description: This test verifies that the getArrivalCity method returns the updated arrival city after it has been modified using the setArrivalCity method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Flight instance and set an initial arrival city using the setArrivalCity method.
  Act: Update the arrival city using the setArrivalCity method with a new value. Call the getArrivalCity method on the Flight instance.
  Assert: Use assertEquals to compare the returned arrival city with the updated value.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the getArrivalCity method retrieves the updated arrival city after it has been modified.
  This test ensures that the getter method reflects any changes made to the arrival city and maintains data consistency.

Note: The test scenarios assume the existence of a setArrivalCity method in the Flight entity based on the provided information. If this method is not present, the scenarios would need to be adjusted accordingly.
