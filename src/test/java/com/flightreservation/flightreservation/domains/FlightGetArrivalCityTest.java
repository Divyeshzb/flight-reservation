Here are the JUnit test scenarios for the getArrivalCity() method:
Scenario 1: Valid Arrival City
Details:
  TestName: validArrivalCity().
  Description: This test verifies that the getArrivalCity() method returns the correct arrival city when a valid arrival city is set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the getArrivalCity() method and set a valid arrival city using the appropriate setter method.
  Act: Invoke the getArrivalCity() method.
  Assert: Use assertEquals() to compare the returned arrival city with the expected arrival city.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the getArrivalCity() method correctly retrieves the arrival city that was set. This test ensures that the method functions as expected when a valid arrival city is provided.
Scenario 2: Null Arrival City
Details:
  TestName: nullArrivalCity().
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the getArrivalCity() method when the arrival city is null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the getArrivalCity() method and do not set any arrival city (leave it as null).
  Act: Invoke the getArrivalCity() method.
  Assert: Use assertNull() to verify that the returned arrival city is null.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the getArrivalCity() method returns null when no arrival city has been set. This test ensures that the method handles the case of a null arrival city correctly and doesn't throw any exceptions.
Scenario 3: Empty Arrival City
Details:
  TestName: emptyArrivalCity().
  Description: This test verifies the behavior of the getArrivalCity() method when the arrival city is an empty string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the getArrivalCity() method and set the arrival city to an empty string using the appropriate setter method.
  Act: Invoke the getArrivalCity() method.
  Assert: Use assertEquals() to compare the returned arrival city with an empty string.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the getArrivalCity() method returns an empty string when the arrival city is set to an empty string. This test ensures that the method handles the case of an empty arrival city correctly and doesn't modify or trim the empty string.
Scenario 4: Arrival City with Leading/Trailing Whitespace
Details:
  TestName: arrivalCityWithWhitespace().
  Description: This test checks if the getArrivalCity() method returns the arrival city with leading/trailing whitespace intact.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the getArrivalCity() method and set the arrival city to a string with leading/trailing whitespace using the appropriate setter method.
  Act: Invoke the getArrivalCity() method.
  Assert: Use assertEquals() to compare the returned arrival city with the expected arrival city, including the leading/trailing whitespace.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the getArrivalCity() method returns the arrival city exactly as it was set, without trimming or modifying the leading/trailing whitespace. This test ensures that the method preserves the original format of the arrival city.
Note: The test scenarios assume the existence of appropriate setter methods for the arrivalCity field, as it is declared as private based on the provided information.
