Here are the JUnit test scenarios for the getDepartureCity() method:
Scenario 1: Test getDepartureCity method with a valid departure city
Details:
  TestName: getDepartureCityWithValidCity
  Description: This test verifies that the getDepartureCity method returns the correct departure city when a valid departure city is set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the departureCity field to a valid city name, such as "New York".
  Act: Call the getDepartureCity method.
  Assert: Use assertEquals to verify that the returned value matches the expected city name.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the getDepartureCity method correctly retrieves the value of the departureCity field.
  This test is important to validate that the getter method functions as expected and returns the correct departure city.
Scenario 2: Test getDepartureCity method with a null departure city
Details:
  TestName: getDepartureCityWithNullCity
  Description: This test verifies that the getDepartureCity method handles the case when the departureCity field is null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the departureCity field to null.
  Act: Call the getDepartureCity method.
  Assert: Use assertNull to verify that the returned value is null.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the getDepartureCity method correctly handles the case when the departureCity field is null and returns null.
  This test is important to validate that the getter method does not throw an exception or return an unexpected value when the departure city is not set.
Scenario 3: Test getDepartureCity method with an empty departure city
Details:
  TestName: getDepartureCityWithEmptyCity
  Description: This test verifies that the getDepartureCity method handles the case when the departureCity field is an empty string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the departureCity field to an empty string ("").
  Act: Call the getDepartureCity method.
  Assert: Use assertEquals to verify that the returned value is an empty string.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the getDepartureCity method correctly handles the case when the departureCity field is an empty string and returns an empty string.
  This test is important to validate that the getter method does not modify or manipulate the empty string value and returns it as is.
Scenario 4: Test getDepartureCity method with a departure city containing special characters
Details:
  TestName: getDepartureCityWithSpecialCharacters
  Description: This test verifies that the getDepartureCity method handles the case when the departureCity field contains special characters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the departureCity field to a city name with special characters, such as "New York!@#".
  Act: Call the getDepartureCity method.
  Assert: Use assertEquals to verify that the returned value matches the expected city name with special characters.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the getDepartureCity method correctly handles the case when the departureCity field contains special characters and returns the value as is.
  This test is important to validate that the getter method does not modify or sanitize the city name and returns it exactly as stored.
These test scenarios cover different cases for the getDepartureCity method, including a valid departure city, a null value, an empty string, and a city name with special characters. They ensure that the method behaves as expected in various scenarios and handles edge cases appropriately.
