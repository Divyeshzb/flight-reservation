Here are the JUnit test scenarios for the setNumberOfBags method:
Scenario 1: Setting a valid number of bags
Details:
  TestName: setValidNumberOfBags
  Description: This test verifies that the setNumberOfBags method correctly sets the numberOfBags field when a valid value is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the setNumberOfBags method.
  Act: Invoke setNumberOfBags with a valid number of bags (e.g., 2).
  Assert: Use assertEquals to verify that the numberOfBags field is set to the provided value.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the numberOfBags field is correctly updated when a valid value is passed to the setNumberOfBags method.
  This test is important to validate that the method functions as expected for normal usage scenarios.
Scenario 2: Setting a negative number of bags
Details:
  TestName: setNegativeNumberOfBags
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the setNumberOfBags method when a negative value is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the setNumberOfBags method.
  Act: Invoke setNumberOfBags with a negative number of bags (e.g., -1).
  Assert: Use assertEquals to verify that the numberOfBags field remains unchanged (i.e., not set to the negative value).
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the setNumberOfBags method does not allow setting a negative value for the numberOfBags field.
  This test is crucial to ensure that the method handles invalid input gracefully and prevents inconsistent state.
Scenario 3: Setting zero bags
Details:
  TestName: setZeroBags
  Description: This test verifies the behavior of the setNumberOfBags method when zero is provided as the number of bags.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the setNumberOfBags method.
  Act: Invoke setNumberOfBags with zero as the number of bags.
  Assert: Use assertEquals to verify that the numberOfBags field is set to zero.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the setNumberOfBags method allows setting the numberOfBags field to zero.
  This test is important to validate that the method handles the edge case of zero bags correctly.
Scenario 4: Setting the number of bags when the passenger is not checked in
Details:
  TestName: setNumberOfBagsWhenNotCheckedIn
  Description: This test verifies that the setNumberOfBags method updates the numberOfBags field even when the passenger is not checked in.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the setNumberOfBags method and ensure that the checkedIn field is set to false.
  Act: Invoke setNumberOfBags with a valid number of bags (e.g., 3).
  Assert: Use assertEquals to verify that the numberOfBags field is set to the provided value.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the setNumberOfBags method updates the numberOfBags field regardless of the checkedIn status.
  This test is important to validate that the method functions independently of the passenger's check-in status.
Scenario 5: Setting the number of bags when the passenger and flight are not set
Details:
  TestName: setNumberOfBagsWhenPassengerAndFlightNotSet
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the setNumberOfBags method when the passenger and flight fields are null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the setNumberOfBags method and ensure that the passenger and flight fields are null.
  Act: Invoke setNumberOfBags with a valid number of bags (e.g., 1).
  Assert: Use assertEquals to verify that the numberOfBags field is set to the provided value.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the setNumberOfBags method updates the numberOfBags field even when the passenger and flight fields are null.
  This test is crucial to ensure that the method operates independently of the associated passenger and flight objects.
These test scenarios cover various aspects of the setNumberOfBags method, including valid and invalid inputs, edge cases, and the method's behavior in different states of the object. They help ensure the correctness and robustness of the method.
