Here are the JUnit test scenarios for the provided setArrivalCity method:
Scenario 1: Set Arrival City to a Valid Value
Details:
  TestName: setArrivalCityWithValidValue
  Description: This test verifies that the setArrivalCity method correctly sets the arrivalCity field when provided with a valid city name.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the setArrivalCity method.
  Act: Invoke the setArrivalCity method with a valid city name, such as "New York".
  Assert: Use assertEquals to verify that the arrivalCity field is set to the provided value.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the arrivalCity field is properly updated when a valid city name is passed to the setArrivalCity method.
  This test is important to validate that the setter method functions as expected and allows setting the arrival city correctly.
Scenario 2: Set Arrival City to null
Details:
  TestName: setArrivalCityWithNull
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the setArrivalCity method when provided with a null value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the setArrivalCity method.
  Act: Invoke the setArrivalCity method with a null value.
  Assert: Use assertNull to verify that the arrivalCity field is set to null.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the setArrivalCity method handles null values correctly and sets the arrivalCity field to null.
  This test is crucial to ensure that the method does not throw any exceptions or have unexpected behavior when given a null value.
Scenario 3: Set Arrival City to an Empty String
Details:
  TestName: setArrivalCityWithEmptyString
  Description: This test verifies the behavior of the setArrivalCity method when provided with an empty string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the setArrivalCity method.
  Act: Invoke the setArrivalCity method with an empty string.
  Assert: Use assertEquals to verify that the arrivalCity field is set to an empty string.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the setArrivalCity method allows setting the arrivalCity field to an empty string.
  This test is important to validate that the method handles empty strings correctly and does not throw any exceptions or have unexpected behavior.
Scenario 4: Set Arrival City to a City Name with Leading/Trailing Whitespace
Details:
  TestName: setArrivalCityWithWhitespace
  Description: This test checks if the setArrivalCity method correctly handles city names with leading/trailing whitespace.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the setArrivalCity method.
  Act: Invoke the setArrivalCity method with a city name containing leading/trailing whitespace, such as "   London   ".
  Assert: Use assertEquals to verify that the arrivalCity field is set to the trimmed value, without any leading/trailing whitespace.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the setArrivalCity method properly trims any leading/trailing whitespace from the provided city name before setting the arrivalCity field.
  This test is important to ensure that the method handles city names with whitespace consistently and stores them in a standardized format.
These test scenarios cover different aspects of the setArrivalCity method, including setting valid city names, handling null values, empty strings, and city names with leading/trailing whitespace. They help ensure the robustness and expected behavior of the method under various conditions.
